# tic_tac_toe
This is the tic-tac-toe game for the 2 human players sitting in front of a same computer.<br>
The programme prints out the board everytime a player makes a move.<br>
This programme uses the "numpad" in a computer to match the numbers to the grid on a tic-tac-toe board.<br>
The numpad is attached for the reference.<br>
The entire logic is present in tic_tac_toe.cpp.
